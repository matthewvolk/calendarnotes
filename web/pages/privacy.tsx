        <p style={{ fontWeight: 300 }}>
          Where applicable, you may have the right to:
        </p>
        <p style={{ fontWeight: 300 }}>
          Request information about how we collect, process, use and share your
          Personal Data (commonly known as a “right to know request”).
        </p>
        <p style={{ fontWeight: 300 }}>
          <b>Request access</b> to your Personal Data (commonly known as a “data
          subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the
          Personal Data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully
          processing it.
        </p>
        <p style={{ fontWeight: 300 }}>
          <b>Request correction</b> of the Personal Data that we hold about you.
          This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold

          new data you provide to us.

        <p style={{ fontWeight: 300 }}>
          <b>Request erasure</b> of your Personal Data (commonly known as a
          “request to be forgotten”). This enables you to ask us to delete or
          remove Personal Data. You also have the right to ask us to delete or
          remove your Personal Data where you have successfully exercised your
          right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed
          your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your
          Personal Data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not
          always be able to comply in full with your request of erasure for
          specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable,
          at the time of your request.

          <b>Object to processing</b> of your Personal Data where we are relying
          on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is
          something about your particular situation which makes you want to
          object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your
          fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object
          where we are processing your Personal Data for direct marketing
          purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling
          legitimate grounds to process your information which override your
          rights and freedoms.

        <p style={{ fontWeight: 300 }}>
          <b>Request restriction</b> of processing of your Personal Data. This
          enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your Personal Data
          in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data’s
          accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not
          want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we
          no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend
          legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we
          need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use

          <b>Withdraw consent</b> at any time where we are relying on consent to
          process your Personal Data. However, this will not affect the
          lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your
          consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide
          certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the
          case at the time you withdraw your consent.

          or quality of Products to you, or suggest that you may receive such
          different treatment. However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your
          request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive.

        <p style={{ fontWeight: 300 }}>
          Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not

        </p>
        <p style={{ fontWeight: 300 }}>
          To determine the appropriate retention period for Personal Data, we
          consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the Personal Data, the
          potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your
          Personal Data, the purposes for which we process your Personal Data
          and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the
          applicable legal requirements.
